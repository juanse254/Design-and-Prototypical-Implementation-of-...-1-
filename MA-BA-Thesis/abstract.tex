Nowadays the cloud architecture is a growing trend that allow us to scale systems without having a physical architecture. This seems to be the future but it also presents several challenges for the current IT System Administrators since cyber attacks are on the growth and the need for performance and availability is also on the growth. In order to mitigate this problem we created a ChatBot using DialogFlow that gathers information from the System Administrator and maps the requirements using pretrained Machine Learning models that use Natural Language Processing to identify and match possible requirements in a few layers of questions using the available System Administrator Tooling such as IPTables, Firewalls, DDoS Managers and so on. The tool will also feature a client that will retrieve the data and further process it using the described architecture to generate a data structure that other tools could use to execute the recommended solutions or to expand into them.
